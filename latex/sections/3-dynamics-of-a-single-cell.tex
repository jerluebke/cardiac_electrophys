\section{Dynamics of a Single Cell}
In this section the results of the numerical solutions for a single cell
using the three models presented above are discussed. All results were
obtained with a simple Forward-Euler scheme.

\subsection{Hodgkin \& Huxley}
The equations were integrated for \SI{10}{\milli\second} with a time step
$\Delta{t}=\SI{.01}{\milli\second}$ (\ie~1000 integrations steps) and an
initial potential $V_0=\SI{-7}{\milli\volt}$.
