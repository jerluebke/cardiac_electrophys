\section{Dynamics of a Single Cell}
In this section the results of the numerical solutions for a single cell
using the three models presented above are discussed. All results were
obtained with a simple Forward-Euler scheme.


\subsection{Hodgkin \& Huxley}
The equations were integrated for \SI{10}{\milli\second} with a time step
$\Delta{t}=\SI{.01}{\milli\second}$ (\ie~1000 integrations steps) and an
initial potential $V_0=\SI{-7}{\milli\volt}$. The resulting action potential,
current densities and gating variables are plotted in \figref{fig:hh1}.

        \label{fig:hh1Gates}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Results of integrating the H\&H model}
    \label{fig:hh1}
\end{figure}

The gating variables were initially all set to 0, yet at
$t=\SI{0}{\milli\second}$ the \ce{Na+} gate $h$ jumps directly to being almost
completely open ($h(t=0)=0.99$); however, the \ce{Na+} current is at this point
suppressed by the closed $m$ gate. The $h$ gate slowly closes up to
$t\approx\SI{5}{\milli\second}$ and then swings down more rapidly, while at the same
time the $m$ gate opens strongly and allows for influx of \ce{Na+} ions
(interestingly the \ce{Na+} current exhibits a small seperate peak at
$t\approx\SI{5}{\milli\second}$ before rising up to its full strength). This
causes the membrane potential to rise up and become strongly positive. Shortly
after the quick opening of the $m$ gate, the \ce{K+} gate $n$ also opens,
allowing for an opposed \ce{K+} outflux causing the membrane potential to
eventually repolarize.

The resulting action potential resembles qualitatively the results depicted in
fig.~12 in \cite{HH52}. An even better fit is achieved when integrating the
system for \SI{40}{\milli\second} with and initial value of
$V_0=\SI{-30}{\milli\volt}$, as depicted in fig.~22 in \cite{HH52} (see
\figref{fig:hh2}).

\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=.75\textwidth]{hh52-40ms}
    \caption{H\&H for \SI{40}{\milli\second}; note the hyperpolarization}
    \label{fig:hh2}
\end{figure}

Another interesting effect can be observed when adding an additional source
current density to equation \eqref{eq:cap}, \ie:
\begin{equation*}
    C\,\dv{V}{t}=-\sum_{s}I_{s} + I_{\mathrm{source}}
\end{equation*}
which causes the membrane potential to depolarize again after repolarization
with a constant rate as depicted in \figref{fig:hh3}. Note, that the cell is
firing with a fixed minimal rate given by $I_{\mathrm{source}}$ (All-or-None
principle).

    \caption{H\&H with
        $I_{\mathrm{source}}=\SI{10}{\ampere\per\metre\squared}$}
    \label{fig:hh3}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Aliev \& Panfilov}
\emph{Note:} The action potential $V$ in this model takes values in $(0,1)$ and
needs to be rescaled according to
$V_{\mathrm{phys}}/\si{\milli\volt}=100\,V-80$. The simulation time $t$ is related
to the physical time via $t_{\mathrm{phys}}/\si{\milli\second}=12.9\,t$.

\vspace{\baselineskip}
The integration was performed for \SI{60}{\stu} (simulationt time units,
\ie~$t_{\mathrm{phys}}=\SI{774}{\milli\second}$) with a time step of
$\Delta{t}=\SI{.01}{\stu}$, resulting in 6000 integration steps and an initial
excitement of the potential to $V_0=\SI{.2}{svu}$ (simulation voltage units,
\ie~$V_{\mathrm{phys},0}=\SI{-60}{\milli\volt}$).

Upon an excitement which surpasses some threshold, the action potential quickly
raises up to its maximal value and decreases rather weakly at first, thus
forming a plateau. The relaxation variable begins raising, too, slowly at
first, but gradually growing faster until it steeply reaches its peak, which
pulls the action potential back to its resting value.

\end{figure}

The model dynamics are governed by a set of five parameters $a, k, \epsilon_0,
\mu_1\text{ and }\mu_2$. They are phenomenological in their nature and therefor
difficult to interpret. A quick study which varies each parameter while holding
the others constant is found in the appendix (\ref{app:ap-params}).


\subsection{Fenton et al}
\emph{Note:} In this model the action potential also takes values in $(0,1)$
and needs to be rescaled with $V_{\mathrm{phys}}/\si{\milli\volt}=100\,V-80$;
however, the simulation time closely resembles the physical time.

\vspace{\baselineskip}
The integration was performed for \SI{400}{\milli\second} using a time step
$\Delta{t}=\SI{.1}{\milli\second}$ (resulting in 4000 integration steps) and
an initial excitement of the potential $V_0=\SI{.3}{\svu}$
(\ie~$V_{\mathrm{phys}}=\SI{-50}{\milli\volt}$).

The resulting action potential qualitatively resembles the result from the
Aliev-Panfilov model, with the difference that the peak does not start
decreasing right after the excitement but rather shows a slight bump in the
plateau.
Just like the Hodgkin-Huxley model, the Fenton model is  based on an ionic
description, which allows to comprehend the action potential dynamics based on
underlying gate and current processes.

Here are a few things to note:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the gate variables are \emph{inactivation gates}, \ie~1 means fully
        closed, while 0 means fully opened
    \item while the fast inactivation gate $v$ opens completely upon
        excitement and then returns into its closed state, the
        slow inactivation gate $w$ does not open completely (only ca.~21\%)
        before closing again rather quickly.
    \item the currents are modeled with Heaviside-functions in order to be
        activated at once when the potential surpasses a certain threshold
        (given by the parameters $V_c$ and $V_v$); this causes the sudden jumps
        in the plots of the current densities
\end{itemize}
